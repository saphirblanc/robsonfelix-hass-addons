# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- Container exited whenever cameras changed. The refresh loop ran `pkill -f monocle-gateway` and started a new gateway in a subshell, but the parent script's `wait $GATEWAY_PID` returned the moment pkill landed and `run.sh` exited — the orphaned gateway in the subshell went down with the container. Replaced with a supervising loop in the parent shell that relaunches the gateway when a `/tmp/monocle-restart-requested` flag is set, and exits with the gateway's status only on unexpected exits.
- `stream_quality` option was wired into config schema and `discover_cameras.py` but missing from `translations/{en,es,pt-BR}.yaml`, so the field rendered without label or description in the HA UI.

### Fixed
- UniFi Protect: Query NVR API directly to get correct `rtspAlias` stream tokens
- RTSP URLs now use proper format: `rtsps://NVR:7441/rtspAlias` (no auth in URL needed)
- Fallback to MAC-based URLs if API query fails

## [0.1.10] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed
- UniFi Protect: Include authentication in RTSP URLs (username:password from HA config)
- Credentials are URL-encoded to handle special characters

## [0.1.9] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- `stream_quality` option: choose between "high", "medium", or "low" resolution streams

### Fixed
- Read config entries and entity registry from HA storage files (API doesn't expose sensitive data)
- UniFi Protect: Extract camera MAC addresses from entity registry unique_ids
- UniFi Protect: Construct proper RTSP URLs with format `rtsps://NVR:7441/MAC?channel=N`
- Use device names from device registry (pretty names like "Gourmet", "Entrada central")
- Improved matching logic using entity_id instead of fuzzy name matching

## [0.1.7] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- Multi-method auto-discovery for RTSP URLs:
  1. go2rtc streams (HA built-in or standalone)
  2. UniFi Protect integration (query config entries + device registry)
  3. Camera entity attributes (stream_source, rtsp_url, etc.)
- Query HA config entries API for UniFi Protect NVR IP
- Query HA device registry for camera IDs
- Construct RTSP URLs from NVR IP + camera IDs

## [0.1.5] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed
- Write token to monocle.token file (required by gateway)
- Remove token from JSON config and logs (security)
- Don't print config file to logs

## [0.1.4] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed
- Use bashio for proper HA add-on integration (fixes SUPERVISOR_TOKEN issue)
- Auto-restart Monocle Gateway when camera config changes (hash-based detection)

## [0.1.3] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed
- Use pip to install requests (Alpine py3-requests is for Python 3.12, base image has 3.13)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed
- Remove --strip-components=1 from tar (tarball has no subdirectory)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed
- Fixed Monocle Gateway download URL (use alpine-x64/alpine-arm64 builds)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- Initial release
- Auto-discover cameras from Home Assistant
- Support for UniFi Protect cameras
- Support for generic camera integration
- Periodic camera list refresh
- Camera name filters
- Monocle Gateway integration
