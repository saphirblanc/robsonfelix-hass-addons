# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.3.3] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- Removed the remaining `stty cols 220 rows 50` line that was appended to `.bashrc` at image build time. This was the line actually breaking Claude Code's TUI rendering — it set the PTY size via ioctl (not just the `COLUMNS` shell var), so Node.js apps believed the terminal was 220 cols wide regardless of the real browser window. Symptom was right-aligned footer text wrapping off-screen.

## [2.3.2] - 2026-04-25

### Changed
- Updated repository metadata to point at the `saphirblanc` fork: `repository.yaml` name/url/maintainer and `claudecode/config.yaml` url.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- Removed hardcoded `COLUMNS=220` from `.bashrc` and `stty cols 220` from `c`/`cc` aliases. The forced width caused misaligned wrapping and text whenever the actual xterm.js terminal wasn't 220 columns wide. The pty now reports the real terminal size, so wrapping follows the browser window.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-24

### Changed
- Disabled tmux mouse mode (`set -g mouse off`). tmux was intercepting all mouse and touch events, breaking native browser copy/paste and iPad touch scrolling. With mouse off, the browser's xterm.js terminal handles scrolling (20,000 line buffer via ttyd) and copy/paste natively. Session persistence is unchanged — tmux still maintains the session across reconnects.

## [2.2.9] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- After `claude update`, running `claude` still used the old version. Login shells (bash --login / tmux) source `/etc/profile` on Alpine which resets PATH to system defaults, dropping `/root/.local/bin`. Added `export PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"` to `.bashrc` so it's always restored for interactive sessions.

## [2.2.8] - 2026-04-16

### Changed
- Rebuild to bundle latest Claude Code at image build time.

## [2.2.7] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- AppArmor profile only grants execute permission (`ixr`) to `/bin/**`, `/usr/bin/**`, `/usr/local/**` etc. — not to `/run.sh` at the filesystem root. Moved startup script to `/usr/local/bin/start-addon.sh` which is in the AppArmor-allowed execution path.

## [2.2.6] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- `run.sh` was committed without the execute bit (mode 100644), causing tini to fail with "Permission denied". Fixed by setting mode 100755 in git and changing CMD to `["/bin/bash", "/run.sh"]` so bash executes the script directly regardless of the file's permission bits.

## [2.2.5] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- Moved all startup logic from an inline Dockerfile CMD bash -c string into a proper `run.sh` shell script. The inline approach caused `\"` quoting to be passed as literal backslashes to jq (breaking the `&&` chain before ttyd started) and shell keywords in the CLAUDE.md content to be misinterpreted as Dockerfile instructions by the linter. The shell script has none of these quoting constraints.

## [2.2.4] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Startup crash: jq filters with string literals (`.terminal_theme // "dark"`, `.model // "claude-sonnet-4-6"`, etc.) were receiving literal backslash-quotes (`\"`) instead of double quotes when run inside the Docker CMD JSON array. Replaced all string literals in jq filters with `--arg` variables which require no quoting.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Add-on failed to start: `claude update` in the startup CMD (no TTY) was hanging waiting for interactive input. Now pipes `yes` and uses `timeout 120` to prevent blocking startup.
- Restored `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1` to prevent Claude Code's background auto-updater from interfering with startup commands (`claude mcp remove/add-json`).

## [2.2.2] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- `claude-update` and auto-update now use `claude update` instead of `npm install -g`. Newer Claude Code versions block npm from overwriting the binary and require using the built-in update command.
- Removed `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1` env var so the built-in updater can function correctly.
- `~/.local/bin/` is now symlinked to persistent storage so updates installed via `claude update` survive add-on restarts and rebuilds.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- `claude-update` and auto-update failing because Claude Code's postinstall script calls `sudo`, which HA's security profile blocks. Added a passthrough `sudo` wrapper (container already runs as root so elevation is unnecessary).

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- `claude-update` terminal alias: run it from the terminal to update Claude Code instantly without restarting the add-on
- Update notification now mentions `claude-update` as an alternative to restarting

### Changed
- No add-on version bump needed to update Claude Code: just restart the add-on (triggers auto-update) or run `claude-update` in the terminal

## [2.1.99] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- Auto-update now shows progress in logs: compares installed vs latest version, logs the update action, and confirms completion — no longer silently hangs with no output

## [2.1.98] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- OAuth URL still wrapping: previous fix set the shell COLUMNS variable but Claude Code is Node.js and reads PTY width via ioctl. Now also runs `stty cols 220` at shell start and before each `claude`/`cc` invocation to set the actual PTY width that Node.js reads.

## [2.1.97] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- Docker cache no longer causes stale Claude Code version in builds: `BUILD_VERSION` (auto-passed by HA) is declared before the npm install, forcing a fresh `@latest` fetch on every version bump

## [2.1.96] - 2026-04-12

### Changed
- Rebuild to pick up latest @anthropic-ai/claude-code release

## [2.1.95] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- "sessionstart: startup hook error": HASS_TOKEN is now injected into the hass-mcp server env config at startup, not only when using the `c` alias

## [2.1.94] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- Build-time Claude Code install now uses `@latest` so the image always ships with the newest version, not whatever npm cached at build time

## [2.1.93] - 2026-04-11

### Changed
- Version bump above upstream 2.1.92 so HA detects this fork as an upgrade

## [1.2.71] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- "ttyd: missing start command" on startup: the `&` operator for the background update checker was splitting the entire preceding `&&` chain into a background subshell, so `$SHELL_CMD` was never set in the foreground process. Fixed by using `;` to terminate the main chain before launching the background loop.

## [1.2.70] - 2026-04-11

### Changed
- Version bump to verify update flow

## [1.2.69] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- HA persistent notification when Claude Code update is available: appears in the HA UI bell/notification area and is automatically dismissed once up-to-date

## [1.2.68] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- Update available notification: background process checks npm hourly and writes a notice file; terminal displays a yellow banner on open when a newer Claude Code version is available

## [1.2.67] - 2026-04-07

### Changed
- Version bump for update flow testing

## [1.2.66] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- Claude Code updates now install to the correct location: replaced `npm update -g` with `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@latest` to match build-time install behavior
- Set `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1` to prevent Claude Code's built-in self-updater from installing to `~/.local/bin/` (a different path that doesn't persist across container restarts)

## [1.2.65] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- OAuth URL displayed as malformed/multi-line in terminal by setting COLUMNS=220 in bash environment, preventing Claude Code from wrapping the auth URL

## [1.2.64] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- Model selection config option: choose between claude-opus-4-6, claude-sonnet-4-6 (default), and claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
- Selected model is applied via ANTHROPIC_MODEL env var at startup
- Auto-update Claude Code (existing feature) keeps new models accessible without add-on updates

## [1.2.63] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed
- Build failure due to `/usr/local/bin/mcp` conflict between hass-mcp (pip) and @playwright/mcp (npm)
- Switched from `npm install -g @playwright/mcp` to npx cache approach (pre-cache during build, `npx --no-install` at runtime)
